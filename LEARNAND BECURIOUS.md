## SITUATION
During my university days, I was given a project to create a chain system using an app called Adams which i had no experience on. I was given two weeks to complete the entire project.

## TASK
I had to create a chain system which fitted on the teeth of the chain mechanism seemlessly without slipping or breaking. This involved learning how the ratio of teeth within the mechanism had to be parallel to the chain.

## ACTION
1. I had to do initial research on the the app Adam. I watched YouTube, explored online forums on how to use Adams features and capabilities.
2. Getting hands -on experience on the app as well as seeking help from my peers. Thier insides helped me avoid common pitfalls and provided valuable tips on using the software effectively.
3. With the solid understanding of the application, i started designing the chain system. I broke down the project into smaller tasks and created a plan to ensure I stayed on track.
4. During the project, up until the end, I sought feedback from my project adviser and made necessary adjustments.

## RESULTS
Despite the  initial challenges of learning the new software under a tight dateline, I successfully design and implemented the chain system within the two weeks time-frame. Additionally, the project earn high marks from my professor and significantly enhance my problem solving skills. This experience thought me the importance of adaptability, effective time management and leveraging available resources to overcome challenges.
